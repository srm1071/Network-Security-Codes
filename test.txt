Throughput as a percentage of bandwidth is a useful measure of how much data you can expect to transfer between your Web server and the user. This “bandwidth utilization” rate tells you how much of the bandwidth you are actually using. Keeping track of your utilization patterns allows you to plan for future growth. For instance, the bandwidth of a typical Internet connection is 1.544 Mbps.If you have an average throughput of 768 Kbps (meaning that 768 Kbps of a potential 1.544 Mbps of data is passing through the network), then your network has a utilization of approximately 50 percent.This bandwidth utilization rate is desirable because it shows that you are not overloading your connection. It is important to keep track of the utilization rate during times that your users are most often connecting to your server. For instance, it is misleading to analyze throughput over a 24-hour period if most of your traffic occurs in a 4-hour time span during the day. If your bandwidth utilization typically remains under 80 percent, your users should be able to display pages without too much of a delay. If the demand for Web pages exceeds these levels, your users will have to wait longer to see each page. Your ISP can often provide you with software to monitor your throughput so that you can determine when your network experiences the heaviest traffic.You also need to realize that you can never reach 100 percent utilization.A difficult task when trying to select the ISP that will provide your Internet connection is finding out what the average throughput will be. Just because all the companies you are considering offer a 1.544 Mbps
